Its smaller pixel size of 75{$\mu$}m {$\times$} 75{$\mu$}m, higher frame rate of up to 22kHz, and practically zero dead-time ({$\sim$}4{$\mu$}s) between exposures will further various measurement methods at synchrotron sources. In this article Eiger's suitability for X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) is demonstrated. By exploiting its high frame rate, complementary small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and XPCS data are collected in parallel to determine both the structure factor and collective diffusion coefficient of a nano-colloid suspension. For the first time, correlation times on the submillisecond time scale are accessible with a large-area pixel detector.},

  abstract={EIGER is the next generation of single photon counting pixel detector for synchrotron radiation designed by the PSI-SLS detector group. It features a pixel size of 75 × 75μm 2 and frame rates up to 23 kHz. The chip contains 256 × 256 pixels, has a total size of 19.3 × 20 mm 2 and provides 4, 8 and 12 bit counting modes. This dynamic range is extendable to 32 bits with continuous read/write and summation of frames on the fly in firmware. Along with X-ray absorption images, the characterization and performance of the chip is presented. The energy calibration, noise, minimum energy threshold and rate capability measured with a single chip test system in a X-ray tube and at the SLS-PSI synchrotron are shown. Trimming studies and irradiation effects are discussed as well. To conclude, the status of the production of larger detector systems consisting of 2 × 4 chip modules and multi modules detector systems (9 Mpixels; 3 × 6 modules) is outlined.}

  abstract={Eiger is a single-photon counting x-ray pixel detector being developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) for applications at synchrotron light sources. It follows the widely utilized and successful Pilatus detector. The main features of Eiger are a pixel size of 75 × 75 μm 2 , high frame rate capability of 22 kHz and negligible dead time between frames of 4 μs. This article contains a detailed description of Eiger detector systems, from the 500 kpixel single-module detector to large-area multi-modules systems. The calibration and performance of the first 500 kpixel system that is in routine user operation are also presented. Furthermore, a method of calibrating the energy of single-photon counting detectors along the detector gain axis is introduced. This approach has the advantage that the detector settings can be optimized at all energies for count rate capabilities. Rate capabilities of the system are reported for energies between 6 and 16 keV.}

In this manuscript we demonstrate fast image acquisition for ptychography using an Eiger detector. We achieve above 25,000 resolution elements per second, or an effective dwell time of 40 $\mu$s per resolution element, when imaging a 500 $\mu$m {\texttimes} 290 $\mu$m region of an integrated electronic circuit with 41 nm resolution. We further present the application of a scheme of sharing information between image parts that allows the field of view to exceed the range of the piezoelectric scanning system and requirements on the stability of the illumination to be relaxed.},

  abstract={EIGER is a single photon counting hybrid pixel detector being developed at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland, for applications at synchrotron light sources in an energy range from a few to 25 keV. EIGER is characterized by a small pixel size (75 × 75 μm 2 ), a frame rate up to 22 kHz and a small dead time between frames (4 μs). An EIGER module is a hybrid detector composed of a ≈ 8 × 4 cm 2 monolithic silicon sensor bump bonded to 4 × 2 readout chips, for a total of 500 kpixels. Each pixel has a configurable depth (up to 12 bits) counter and records the number of photons impinging. Custom designed module electronics reads out the bits in the pixel counter and processes the data in the module before transferring them to a PC. A large dynamic range (32 bits) for the pixel counter can be obtained through on-board image summation. Rate corrections can be applied on-board to compensate for inefficiencies when the pixel counting rates approach pile-up levels around a million counts per second. The EIGER modules are the building blocks of large area detectors: a 1.5 and a 9 Mpixel systems are under development for the cSAXS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at PSI. The very high frame rate capabilities are equally fast for multi-module systems due to the fully parallel data processing.The module calibration will be discussed, with emphasis on the choice of the optimal operation settings as a function of photon energy. The performance regarding threshold dispersion and minimum achievable threshold will be presented. In addition, the progress towards the production of larger multi-module systems will be discussed.}

abstract = {EIGER is a single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland. It is designed for applications at synchrotron light sources with photon energies above 5keV. Features of EIGER include a small pixel size (75{$\mu$}m {$\times$} 75{$\mu$}m), a high frame rate (up to 23kHz), a small dead-time between frames (down to 3{$\mu$}s) and a dynamic range up to 32-bit. In this article, the use of EIGER as a detector for electrons in low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is reported. It is demonstrated that, with only a minimal modification to the sensitive part of the detector, EIGER is able to detect electrons emitted or reflected by the sample and accelerated to 8{--}20keV. The imaging capabilities are shown to be superior to the standard microchannel plate detector for these types of applications. This is due to the much higher signal-to-noise ratio, better homogeneity and improved dynamic range. In addition, the operation of the EIGER detector is not affected by radiation damage from electrons in the present energy range and guarantees more stable performance over time. To benchmark the detector capabilities, LEEM experiments are performed on selected surfaces and the magnetic and electronic properties of individual iron nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 8 to 22nm are detected using the PEEM endstation at the Surface/Interface Microscopy (SIM) beamline of the Swiss Light Source.},
